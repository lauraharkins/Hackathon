#GPTHack: Turning Language in Platforms

##Description
This is our submission to the Encode AI London Hackathon Virtual Protocol: Best AI Use Case for Gaming, Social or Digital Entertainment bounty. In this project, we created an inifinite platforming game with a twist,
the levels are generated by a language model! Instead of using a standard, more traditional level generation routine, we exploited the sequence-based and context aware nature of generative language models to create playable
levels following a defined schematic. This demonstrates the potential of these models, as they are not only powerful for language applications but, with some out of the box thinking, can be used to generate visual worlds using only text.

##Use Case
This project demostrates a proof-of-concept of content-generation ability of current open source language models in the visual domain. We show that with the right fine-tuning, the [distilgpt2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilgpt2) model
can generate unique, playable levels for a platformer-style video game. This has an inital use case of
